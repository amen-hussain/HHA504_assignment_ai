Exploring AI and Analytics with Pre-trained Models in Azure and GCP


1. Work with Pre-trained Speech Models
GCP Speech-to-Text:
Navigate to GCP and access the Vertex AI Notebooks.
Use a pre-configured notebook to interact with the GCP Speech-to-Text API.
Upload a sample audio file and transcribe it using the pre-trained speech model.
Document the results and the steps you took to achieve them.

1. navigate to vertex ai notebook.
2. enable all APIs.
3. Notebook --> Workbench --> User-managed notebooks.

3. Work with Pre-trained Vision Models
GCP Vision API:

In the same or a new notebook, interact with the GCP Vision API.
Upload an image and use the Vision API to detect objects or text within the image.
Document the results and provide a brief analysis of the model's accuracy.
Azure AI Vision:

Switch to Azure and access Azure Machine Learning (AML) Notebooks.
Use a pre-trained vision model in AML to perform a similar task as with GCP, such as object detection or text recognition.
Compare the results with those from GCP and document your findings.
